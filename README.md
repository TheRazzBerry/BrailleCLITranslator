# BrailleCLITranslator
Originally a coding challenge for Shopify's Fall - Winter 2025 Engineering internship program.

## Technical Requirements
- Translator
  - Given arguments passed into the program at runtime, determine if the given string should be translated to English or Braille.
  - For Braille, each character is stored as a series of `O` (the letter O) or `.` (a period).
  - Store Braille symbols as a 6 character string reading left to right, line by line, starting at the top left. See examples below.
  - When a Braille `capital follows` symbol is read, assume only the next symbol should be capitalized. 
  - When a Braille `number follows` symbol is read, assume all following symbols are numbers until the next `space` symbol.
- Braille Alphabet
  - Letters `a` through `z`
    - The ability to capitalize letters
  - Numbers `0` through `9`
  - The ability to include `spaces` ie: multiple words
